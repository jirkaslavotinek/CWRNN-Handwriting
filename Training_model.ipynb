    "# Generating handwriting with Clockwork-RNN\n",
    "This is the implementation of handwriting generation with Clockwork-RNN(CWRNN) in Mixture Density Network(MDN).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind MDN is to use neural network outputs to parameterise a mixture distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind CWRNN is to use more RNN cells but not to use all of them in every timestep. Cells in CWRNN have periods which tell us in what timestep the cell should be active.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implemetation is heavily influenced by these projects:\n",
